# L1Trigger_VBF_BDT
A repository to pull into the "test" folder of the Run3Ntuplizer. Contains all the files to recreate the BDT and rates metrics. 

First fork isobelojalvo/Run3Ntuplizer (I would not recommend forking adropulic/Run3Ntuplizer because there are many unnecessary files)
Then, make sure some of the scripts are updated with my versions (you can tell which scripts need to be updated because you'll see I just pushed commits on 05/28/21)
Then put this repo in the "test" folder of Run3Ntuplizer
Then put hls_bdt project in the "test" folder of the Run3Ntuplier
